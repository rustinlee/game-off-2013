			<h1>Armipotent</h1>
			<h2>Foreword</h2>
			<p>Armipotent started as an exercise in blending platforming and danmaku shooters, my two favorite genres. This has been my first (semi)successful foray into a real game jam and to ride with it start to finish gave me a lot more perspective on a lot of things. Like most projects of mine it got off to a strong start, limped through the middle and ended with me staying up for 17 hours frantically trying to finish it. Well, I sort of did, and here are the results. I had to cut a lot of what I wanted to see in the final game: there were five weapons planned, leveling up with different weapons was going to provide persistent stat bonuses, much more artistic variation between the weapons, and a lot of other stuff. I actually had a full soundtrack arranged by the artist but it didn't make it in. Anyway... I'm not particularly upset with what I'm left with, and the direction it was headed, and I'm excited to continue work on it after the contest. Until then, I hope you can have some fun with the engine as it is.</p>
